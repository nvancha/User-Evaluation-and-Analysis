# Training Approach Analysis Project

This project aims to analyze the effectiveness and preference of different training methods—Virtual Reality (VR) training, coach-led training, and video training—among employees. It utilizes statistical tests to determine the most efficient training method and explores the preference for training methods across various age groups.

## Overview

The project is divided into two parts:
- **Part A** focuses on the effectiveness of the training methods by analyzing the time to finish a check-out task.
- **Part B** examines the preference for training methods among new employees of different age groups.

## Analysis Questions and Hypotheses

### Part A: ANOVA Test

- **Q1:** Is there a significant difference in the time to finish a check-out task between VR training, coach training, or video training?

### Part B: Chi-Squared Test

- **Q2:** Is there a significant difference in the training method preference among new employees of different age groups?

## Statistical Analysis

### ANOVA Test
- Conducted to compare the times to finish a check-out task for the different training methods.
- **F-value and P-value:** Determined from the analysis (see `Project.xls`).

### Scheffe Post Hoc Test
- Conducted to perform pairwise comparisons between training methods.
- **P-value:** Obtained for each pair to determine significant differences (see `Project.xls`).

### Chi-Squared Test
- Used to assess the preference for training methods among different age groups.
- **Expected Values & Chi-Square Test Results:** Detailed in the attached `image.png`.

## Conclusions

- From the ANOVA test, the null hypothesis is rejected, indicating a significant difference in the effectiveness of training methods.
- The Scheffe Post Hoc test results suggest significant differences between specific training methods.
- The Chi-Squared test leads to rejecting the null hypothesis, showing that age influences training method preference.

## Suggested Metrics

- **Retention Rate:** Measures how effectively employees retain the skills and knowledge post-training.
- **Measurement Method:** Follow-up assessments to evaluate the long-term retention of training.

## Files and Directories

## How to Run the Analysis

1. Review the hypotheses and analysis questions in `README.md`.
2. Open `Project.xls` to view the detailed statistical results and perform additional analysis if needed.
3. Use statistical software to replicate the ANOVA and Chi-Squared tests using the data and methodologies outlined.
