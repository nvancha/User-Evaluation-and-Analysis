# Training Approach Analysis Project

This project evaluates the effectiveness and preferences of various training methodsâ€”Virtual Reality (VR) training, coach-led training, and video training. Statistical analyses, such as ANOVA and Chi-Squared tests, have been conducted to compare the performance and appeal of these methods among employees of different age groups.

## Files and Directories

- `Project3.xlsx`: Contains the raw data used in the analysis and the results of the statistical tests such as ANOVA and Chi-Squared tests.
- `Project3Doc.docx`: Includes a detailed report of the methodologies, analysis process, and interpretations of the statistical results.

## Statistical Analysis Overview

The project's statistical component aims to answer two primary questions:

1. Is there a significant difference in the time to finish a check-out task among VR training, coach training, or video training?
2. Is there a preference for a specific training method among new employees of various age groups?

## Hypotheses

- **Null Hypothesis for ANOVA (H0)**: No significant difference in time across the three training methods.
- **Alternative Hypothesis for ANOVA (H1)**: VR training significantly reduces the time to finish a check-out compared to the other methods.
- **Null Hypothesis for Chi-Squared Test (H0)**: No significant preference for training methods among different age groups.

## Conclusions

The analyses led to the rejection of the null hypotheses, indicating significant differences in both the effectiveness of the training methods and the preferences of the employees based on their age group.

## How to Use
